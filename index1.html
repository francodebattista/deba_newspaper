            <p class="first-line">Yesterday saw two huge clues for what Big Tech can expect in the years to come.</p>
            <p>In the US, both the Democrats and the Republicans now have a fixed position on regulating tech.</p>
            <p>They are both totally different.</p>
            <p>First off, Trump.</p>
            <p>After the President shared a piece of disinformation on Facebook and Twitter about the relative dangers of Covid, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54440662">the two companies reacted</a>: Twitter hid his post and Facebook removed it altogether.</p>
            <p>Trump responded by tweeting "Repeal Section 230!!!".</p>
            <p>This is a key piece of legislation that stops companies like Facebook and Twitter from being liable for the things people post.</p>
            <p>It essentially gives them "platform" rather than "publisher" status.</p>
        </div>  
        <div class="main-split">
            <h2>Impossible task</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Just imagine for a second if all of the posts on Facebook - all of the accusations, all of the libellous content, all of it - was the responsibility of Mark Zuckerberg</p>
            <p>It doesn't work. Without Section 230 companies like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok etc couldn't function as they do now. They'd potentially have to moderate your content in real time.</p>
            <p>Even for the most powerful artificial intelligence systems, that is not possible.</p>
            <p>You might think: "Trump says he'll repeal Section 230, but will he actually?"</p>

            <figcaption>President Trump posted his call for reform after the social networks intervened over one of his posts about Covid-19</figcaption>
            <p>My response would be: "Look at TikTok."</p>
            <p>Trump has well and truly followed up on his actions - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54316992"> without a judge's last minute intervention</a> it would be illegal for Apple and Google's app stores to offer TikTok for download in the US now.</p>
            <p>It's perfectly conceivable that a Trump presidency would follow through with his campaign threats.</p>
            <p>Plenty of Republicans believe that much of social media has an anti-conservative bias. Trump would certainly find support from his own party to act.</p>

        <div class="main-split">
            <h2>Competition clash</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The other big tech news from Tuesday <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54443188"> was the release of The House Judiciary Committee's report into "antitrust"</a>.</p>
            <p>This is the idea that Big Tech has got so big it is now flouts anti-competition rules.</p>
            <p>This is a Democrat-led committee - the report was written by Democrats.</p>
            <p>The report concludes: "To put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog start-ups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons."</p>
            <!--images CEO-->
            <img src="images/CEOS.jpg" alt="ceos">
            <figcaption>The chief executives of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple gave testimony to Congress in July</figcaption>
            <P>The share price of all four companies dived as soon as the report was released.</P>
            <P>Literally, the first recommendation is to prohibit "dominant platforms from operating in adjacent lines of business".</P>
            <P>That would be massive. It could potentially stop companies like Google owning YouTube. Or Facebook owning Instagram.</P>
            <P>The word "monopoly" is used 120 times in the report.</P>
            <P>These weren't bi-partisan recommendations though - Republicans didn't support all the findings.</P>
            <P>However, there is some common ground between the parties.</P>
            <P>For example, Republican Ken Buck has said he agrees with much of the report.</P>
            <P>And in terms of Section 230, Biden has also indicated he could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html"> getting rid of it </a>- albeit for different reasons to Trump.</P>

        <div class="main-split">
            <H2>Big Tech election</H2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <P>And so we have two Presidential candidates, each with his own stick to bash Big Tech.</P>
            <P>The company that perhaps is least hedged against these two approaches is Facebook. It's hard to know which option would be worse for the social network.</P>

            <figcaption>If Joe Biden becomes the US President, calls to break up Big Tech could grow</figcaption>
            <p>For others, well there's now a reasonable argument that can be made that Trump would be better.</p>
            <p>Republican focus on social media bias would pretty much leave Apple and perhaps Amazon untouched.</p>
            <p>The election issues in this campaign have been centred around Covid, Black Lives Matter, the economy and law enforcement.</p>
            <p>But make no mistake, this is a huge election for Big Tech too.</p>
